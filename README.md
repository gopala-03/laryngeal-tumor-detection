# laryngeal-tumor-detection
This project embarks on the development of a deep learning model aimed at early detection of laryngeal tumors in medical images, recognizing the critical importance of timely intervention in addressing this life-threatening condition. In this the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is used for identification of laryngeal tumor.
